Here are some steps you can reference for starting a baby step into machine learning.

I'll recommand you to install Anaconda3 in order to run the code in all notebooks and it quite reduces the time on preparation for the environment.

All codes and jupyter notebooks are using Python3 and part of the notes are from CS299 taught by Ng Wu in Stanford University.

The packages you may need to use are list in the 'requirement.txt'.
